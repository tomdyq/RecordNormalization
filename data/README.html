<h2>Publication Conference Name Normalization Data</h2>

<p> This data contains lists of conference and journal names culled from the Web by Aron Culotta.  Given a set of strings referring to the same conference, the task is to generate a uniform, standard string for each group of true matching conference names, which is denoted by the <b>normalized</b> one. 
</p>

<p> There are three files in the data. 
<li>
	<i>ConferenceName_non_standard.csv</i> - It contains 3,683 conference name strings of 100 unique ones, which are collected from the web. It has three columns:rid, label and conference_name. 
	<blockquote>
		<li><i>rid</i> denotes the index of the conference name strings</li>
		<li><i>label</i> denotes the index of the unique conference name strings</li>
		<li><i>conference_name</i> denotes the string of the conference name</li>
	</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
	<i>ConferenceName_standard_old.csv</i> - It contains 100 normalized conference name strings labelled by <font color='red'>Aron Culotta</font>. It has two columns: label and conference_name. 
	<blockquote>
		<li><i>label</i> denotes the index of 100 normalized conference name strings</li>
		<li><i>conference_name</i> denotes the string of the normalized conference name corresponding to its <i>label</i></li>
	</blockquote>
</li>
